# pythonPassProtect

pythonPassProtect is a really simple Python program to secure your passwords by replacing certain characters.

# How to use?

pythonPassProtect when run, will ask if you want to store your encoded passowrd in a file called myPws.txt, which is already made in the directory. 
Next it asks for your password, which is inputted using getpass.getpass, so no one can see what you type.
Then, if you had entered 1 in step 1, it will ask you for the username or related keyword for the password so that when you open myPws.txt you know which account the given password is for.
Lastly, it will ask you to type or enter 1 to copy the password to your clipboard.
